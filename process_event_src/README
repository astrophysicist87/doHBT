Description: Takes output from iEBE package and computes
HBT radii from it.  Can also compute anisotropic flows.

HBT radii can be calculated by source variances, Gaussian
fitting, or the so-called "q-moments" method.  Currently,
only the first two of these have been implemented in this
package.

This package does not yet include resonance decay con-
tributions to the emission function.
